Approach
---------

There is nothing new about a sankey diagram. The problem of drawing one with d3 has been solved long ago. You can refer to this [interactive demonstration by Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/sankey/).

My contribution is of slightly different nature. How to organize the code to make it easy to reuse. Provide reusable components without imposing any dependency on a framework. The Sankey diagram is the first to come out. Others components will follow. Some will be based on d3, others not. 

That approach is described in [vanilla-class github project][https://github.com/widged/vanilla-class]
